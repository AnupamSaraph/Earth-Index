                        of our home, Earth. The Earth Index is an average of the scores for interactions people
                        have with each other, with other life forms, with ecosystems, and
                        with the systems and organizations they create to improve livability.

                        highest and and 20 that had the lowest Earth Index scores in

                                <h3>The conversations we have shape our world</h3>
                                <p>The Earth Index provides us a means to engage in a conversation of Investment.
                                    It provides us to engage with a common purpose of ensuring the
                                    liveability of our planet, and helps to draw us away from short-sighted purpose
                                    of exploiting our planet at the cost of the liveability of our Earth.</p>
                                <p> By reporting the Investments countries make to liveability of our planet, we
                                    offer conversations to find directions for better interactions with each other,
                                    other species, with our ecosystems, and with organizations and systems of our
                                    design.</p>
                                <p>The ability to recognize our Investments to the liveability of our planet is a
                                    proactive way to manage risk. It supports our ESG (Environment, Sustainability, and
                                    Governance) frameworks to include the liveability of our planet and a sustainable
                                    means
                                    to impact investing. By encouraging countries to contribute to the liveability of
                                    our
                                    planet, we also protect the return on our investments by ensuring both: human
                                    well-being
                                    and economic well-being.</p>
                                <p>There is, therefore, a need to report the good we do for the liveability of the
                                    planet.
                                    There is a need to reinforce the good. The Earth Index addresses that need to allow
                                    us
                                    to recognize, value, and improve the Investments we make to the liveability of our
                                    planet. It supports our efforts to improve our interactions with each
                                    other, with other life forms, with ecosystems, and with the human designed systems
                                    and
                                    organizations in our countries.
