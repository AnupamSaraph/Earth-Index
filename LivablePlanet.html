                                <p>
                                    Different species - animals, plants, and microbes - play a critical role in making
                                    our planet liveable. Like the organs in our body that play a role in maintaining
                                    conditions that ensure liveability, these species maintain
                                    conditions that keep our planet liveable. It is important, therefore,
                                    that they are able to occupy their niche that allows them to contribute to the
                                    liveability of our planet. The less the space other species can occupy, the less
                                    likely they can play their role to keep our planet liveable.
                                    Interactions of people with other species, therefore, that leave space for the other
                                    species - and show
                                    restraint from occupying all the land, air, and water in their country - contribute
                                    to
                                    the liveability of our planet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The more the space that a country leaves for other species, the more it contributes
                                    to the liveability of our planet.
                                </p>

                                <p>Ecosystems provide niches for life to thrive, create conditions for liveability,
                                    and to ensure that our planet is habitable. When different species interact with
                                    ecosystems, their care or aggression result in changing the ability of the
                                    ecosystem to regenerate. The more the intensity of activity of a species, the
